I recently found out that I've been dealing with some kind of attention disorder without even knowing it. Truth be told, it has been eye-opening to discover how much my mind itself prevents me from being productive.

One thing I've noticed is how hard it can be to just get things done sometimes. I'll start a task, and then suddenly find myself diving deeper and deeper into one small part of it. It's like I get tunnel vision. I spend ages obsessing over minor details, tweaking them over and over.

The problem is, while I'm stuck in that detail, time just flies by. Before I know it, hours have passed, and I haven't made much progress on the bigger picture. All that time spent on small stuff means the larger goals get lost.

And honestly? After spending so much time on one thing, I just get bored or frustrated. The initial excitement fades, and it becomes a struggle to push through. It's definitely hampered my productivity over the years—getting lost in the weeds, running out of steam, and not finishing as much as I'd like.

People often tell me to "just write down a list." And while that usually works, it's only half the battle for me.

The other issue is that I seem to have difficulty laying out tasks and deciding the order in which to execute them. And if I get distracted? It takes a miracle—or a seriously annoyed stakeholder (like my wife)—to get me back on track with the initial thing I was working on.

Recently, I had an idea: what if I could visualize my tasks as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that ultimately leads to completing my higher-order goals in life? For example, my current duties at the moment are as follows:

- Get SWE interviews (follow up on LinkedIn connections, make new ones for companies I'm interested in)
- Prepare for SWE interviews (study system design and complete Neetcode's roadmap)
- Complete my driver's ed for a ticket I got
- Finish building my consulting website
